			Our activities will begin in the summer of 2015 thanks to the seed funding granted by the CONACYT-British Council <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/education/science/institutional-links">Newton Institutional Links Programme</a> for the execution of the core project "Innovative quenching technologies for the manufacture of forged critical components in off-shore structures"  in partnership with <a href="http://www.frisa.com/es/index.html">Frisa</a>. With the creation of this network, our aim is to grow beyond the time frame and scope of the core project by adding more partners in the future, both academic and industrial.
